# Design_Optimsation_On_WheelChair

This project aimed to improve the mobility of people with special needs by
developing a low-cost, motorized wheelchair through the repair and
modification of an existing wheelchair. The project encountered various
challenges, such as designing an effective steering and braking system. In
response, the team developed a novel steering system that utilizes a push-pull
cable and incorporates scrap material and an old wheelchair to keep costs low.
The steering system was designed and built in-house and is a developing
technique that offers a low-cost alternative to traditional steering systems. The
project's main focus was on making the product affordable while delivering
high results. Overall, this project represents a small yet valuable effort towards
improving the quality of life for individuals with special needs.
